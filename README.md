Recap basics of Git and GitHub
Just adding a few lines to my Readme.text (ot is it readme.md) file for the sake of it.

After cloning to my local repo ( I used GitHub Desktop version which made things a lot easier ) - I just added these lines to see if after pushing, the changes will take effect in my remote repo in GitHub

I was able to upload.
Not let's see if I can download this to my local repo with this additions
